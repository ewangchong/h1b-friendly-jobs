### ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND**

#### 1. Authentication System Issues
**Issue:** Profile creation fails with 401 Unauthorized error  
**Impact:** HIGH - Affects user registration and account features  
**Details:** 
- User registration redirects to login instead of auto-login
- Profile creation in database fails due to authentication issues
- Saved jobs functionality may be affected

**Fix Required:**
```javascript
// In AuthContext.tsx, update signUp function
async function signUp(email: string, password: string, fullName?: string) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
    email,
    password,
    options: {
      data: {
        full_name: fullName || ''
      }
    }
  })
  
  if (error) return { data, error }
  
  // Create profile after successful signup
  if (data.user && !error) {
    try {
      const { error: profileError } = await supabase
        .from('profiles')
        .insert({
          user_id: data.user.id,
          email: email,
          full_name: fullName || '',
          created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
          updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
        })
      
      if (profileError) console.error('Profile creation error:', profileError)
    } catch (profileError) {
      console.error('Error creating profile:', profileError)
    }
  }
  
  return { data, error }
}
```

#### 2. Job Filtering System Not Functional
**Issue:** Filter changes don't update search results  
**Impact:** HIGH - Core job search functionality broken  
**Details:**
- H1B sponsorship filter toggle doesn't work
- Search results don't refresh when filters are changed
- Filter state management issues

**Fix Required:**
```javascript
// In JobsPage.tsx, fix filter update mechanism
useEffect(() => {
  // Force query refetch when filters change
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['jobs'] })
}, [filters, queryClient])
```

#### 3. Error Handling Deficiencies
**Issue:** Missing user-friendly error messages and 404 pages  
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Poor user experience for edge cases  
**Details:**
- Invalid login attempts show no error message to user
- No custom 404 error page for invalid URLs
- Network errors not handled gracefully

**Fix Required:**
```javascript
// Add proper error handling in LoginPage.tsx
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  setIsLoading(true)
  
  try {
    const { error } = await signIn(email, password)
    if (error) {
      // Show specific error message to user
      if (error.message.includes('Invalid login credentials')) {
        toast.error('Invalid email or password. Please check your credentials.')
      } else {
        toast.error(error.message)
      }
    } else {
      toast.success('Signed in successfully')
      navigate(from, { replace: true })
    }
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error('An unexpected error occurred. Please try again.')
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false)
  }
}
```
