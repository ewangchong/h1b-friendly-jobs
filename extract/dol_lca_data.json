{"extracted_information": "The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) provides downloadable Labor Condition Application (LCA) disclosure data files. These files are available in Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) format, which is a machine-readable format.

These layouts are crucial for understanding the exact information contained, including details like job titles, salary information, and company names, although personally identifiable information (PII) such as Federal Employer Identification Numbers (FEIN), attorney state bar numbers, and foreign worker names/addresses are excluded.
