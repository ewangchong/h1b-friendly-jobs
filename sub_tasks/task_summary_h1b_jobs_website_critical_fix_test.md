# h1b_jobs_website_critical_fix_test

The H1B jobs website has critical issues with its 'Apply on company site' links. While pagination has been replaced by infinite scroll, the primary function of applying for jobs is broken. All 'Apply on company site' links tested resulted in error pages, preventing users from reaching the company career pages. This is a critical bug that needs to be addressed immediately.
