# H1B_jobs_website_testing

I have completed the comprehensive testing of the H1B jobs website. I tested the homepage, user authentication, job search and filtering, job details, company profiles, and error handling. I found several critical issues, including a non-functional filtering system, a lack of a user-friendly 404 page, and no error message on the login page for invalid credentials. These issues significantly impact the user experience and the overall functionality of the website.
