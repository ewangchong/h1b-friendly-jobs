## Git Branch Consolidation & Documentation Organization Complete

Successfully completed the Git repository reorganization and documentation consolidation for the H1B Friendly Jobs project:

### Key Accomplishments:
1. **Git Branch Management**: Merged and consolidated `master` and `main` branches, keeping `main` as the single working version with all latest features and code
2. **Documentation Organization**: Moved all 22 markdown documentation files from the workspace root to the `/docs/` folder 
3. **Repository Cleanup**: Deleted the redundant `master` branch both locally and remotely
4. **Documentation Index**: Created a comprehensive README.md index in the docs folder categorizing all documentation by type (Setup, Technical, Testing, etc.)

### Final Repository Status:
- **Single clean branch**: `main` contains all latest code and documentation
- **Organized structure**: All technical documentation consolidated in `/docs/` folder
- **Essential files preserved**: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and LICENSE kept in root
- **GitHub updated**: All changes pushed to https://github.com/ewangchong/h1b-friendly-jobs

The repository now has a professional, maintainable structure that will facilitate easier navigation for contributors and users of the H1B Friendly Jobs platform.
