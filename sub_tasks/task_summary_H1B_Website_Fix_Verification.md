# H1B_Website_Fix_Verification

Completed testing of the updated H1B jobs website. Verified that user registration, job filtering, and the 404 error page are now working correctly. The "Saved Jobs" functionality is also working as expected. However, the critical issue of the login page not displaying an error message for invalid credentials remains unresolved.
