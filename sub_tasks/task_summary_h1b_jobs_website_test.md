## H1B Jobs Website End-to-End Test Summary

This report details the comprehensive end-to-end testing of the H1B jobs website at https://8lhoiadobo17.space.minimax.io. The testing covered homepage loading, navigation, job search and filtering, job detail pages, company pages, and user interface elements.

### Execution Process:

1.  **Homepage and Navigation:** Successfully navigated to the homepage and verified that all navigation links ("Jobs", "Companies") work correctly.
2.  **Job Search and Filtering:**
    *   Searched for "software engineer" jobs, and the results were relevant.
    *   Applied a location filter for "San Francisco," which correctly narrowed down the results.
    *   Tested the H1B sponsorship filter. While the filter appeared to be on by default, attempting to turn it off did not update the search results, indicating a potential bug.
3.  **Job Detail Pages:**
    *   Viewed a job detail page, which correctly displayed all job-related information, including the job description, company details, and application links.
    *   Attempted to use the "Save Job" functionality, which did not provide any feedback or prompt for login, suggesting it may not be working as intended for non-logged-in users.
    *   Located the feedback mechanism ("Sign in to report job accuracy"), which requires user authentication to function.
4.  **Company Pages:** Navigated to a company detail page, which correctly displayed the company's H1B statistics and current job openings.
5.  **Console Health:** Checked for console errors and found none, indicating good front-end health.

### Key Findings:

*   **Core functionality is largely in place:** The website's main features, such as navigation, job search, and viewing job/company details, are functional.
*   **Filter functionality issue:** The H1B sponsorship filter does not appear to be working correctly when attempting to disable it.
*   **"Save Job" ambiguity:** The "Save Job" button lacks user feedback when clicked by a non-logged-in user. It should ideally prompt the user to log in.
*   **Authentication required for key features:** Saving jobs and providing feedback require user authentication, which is a reasonable design choice but could be communicated more clearly to the user.

### Core Conclusions:

The H1B jobs website is a functional platform with a solid foundation. The core features for finding and viewing H1B-friendly jobs are working well. However, there are a few areas that require attention, particularly the H1B filter functionality and the user feedback for the "Save Job" feature. Addressing these minor issues would significantly improve the user experience and overall robustness of the platform.

### Final Deliverables:

*   This summary provides a comprehensive overview of the testing process and findings.
