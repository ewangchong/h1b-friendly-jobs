# H1B Jobs Platform: Recommended Data Architecture & Compliance

This document provides recommendations for the data backend of an H1B-friendly jobs website, along with a summary of legal and compliance considerations.

## 1. Recommended Data Architecture

A hybrid approach that combines government data with web-scraped job listings is recommended for building a comprehensive H1B jobs platform.

**Core Components:**

1.  **H1B Sponsor Database:**
    *   **Data Sources:** USCIS H-1B Employer Data Hub, Department of Labor (DOL) LCA Data.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Create a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store the structured data from USCIS and DOL.
        *   Develop scripts to periodically download and import the latest data from these sources.
        *   Create a data model that links companies to their H1B sponsorship history, including job titles, salaries, and approval rates.
        *   This database will serve as the foundation for identifying H1B-friendly companies.

2.  **Live Job Listings Engine:**
    *   **Data Sources:** Web scraping of major job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor) and specialized H1B job boards.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Develop a robust and scalable web scraping infrastructure.
        *   Use a combination of direct requests, headless browsers, and proxy services to avoid getting blocked.
        *   Implement a parsing engine to extract relevant information from job postings, including job title, description, company name, and location.
        *   Use natural language processing (NLP) to identify keywords and phrases that indicate H1B sponsorship (e.g., "H1B visa sponsorship available," "willing to sponsor").
        *   Store the scraped job listings in a NoSQL database (e.g., Elasticsearch, MongoDB) for flexible searching and filtering.

3.  **Data Integration & Enrichment:**
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Develop a process to match the companies from the live job listings with the companies in the H1B Sponsor Database.
        *   Enrich the job listings with the historical H1B sponsorship data, providing users with valuable context about a potential employer.
        *   For example, when a user views a job posting, they can also see the company's H1B approval rate, the number of visas they have sponsored in the past, and the typical salaries for similar roles.

```

## 2. Legal & Compliance Considerations

Building an H1B jobs platform requires careful attention to legal and compliance issues.

*   **Web Scraping:**
    *   **Terms of Service:** Carefully review the terms of service for each job board you intend to scrape. Many explicitly prohibit scraping.
    *   **Copyright:** Be mindful of copyright law. You can likely use factual data from job postings (job title, company name, location), but avoid copying and pasting entire job descriptions without permission.
    *   **Trespass to Chattels:** Excessive scraping that harms a website's performance could lead to legal claims.
    *   **Best Practices:** Implement ethical scraping practices, such as respecting `robots.txt`, limiting request rates, and identifying your scraper with a user-agent string.

*   **Data Privacy:**
    *   **PII:** Be extremely careful not to collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) from job seekers or employees.
    *   **GDPR/CCPA:** If you plan to serve users in Europe or California, you must be aware of and comply with data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

*   **Government Data Usage:**
    *   **Attribution:** While government data is in the public domain, it's good practice to attribute the source of your data (USCIS and DOL).
    *   **Disclaimer:** Include a disclaimer on your website stating that the H1B data is from public government sources and that you are not affiliated with the U.S. government.

*   **Consult Legal Counsel:**
    *   It is **highly recommended** to consult with a lawyer who specializes in internet and data privacy law before launching your platform. They can provide guidance on your specific situation and help you mitigate legal risks.
