# Research Plan: H1B Job Data Sources

## Objectives
- Identify and evaluate data sources for H1B-friendly job listings.
- Research government and official H1B data for company sponsorship information.
- Investigate existing company H1B sponsorship databases.
- Explore technical implementation options and best practices for job aggregation platforms.
- Analyze data quality, legal considerations, and compliance requirements.

## Research Breakdown
- **Phase 1: Job Board APIs & Data Sources**
  - Sub-task 1.1: Search for APIs from major job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor) with H1B data.
  - Sub-task 1.2: Identify specialized H1B job boards and check for data access (APIs, data dumps).
  - Sub-task 1.3: Look for job data aggregation services that include H1B information.
- **Phase 2: Government & Official H1B Data**
  - Sub-task 2.1: Research USCIS H1B employer data and LCA databases.
  - Sub-task 2.2: Investigate Department of Labor (DOL) databases for H1B sponsorship history.
  - Sub-task 2.3: Find sources for H1B approval/denial statistics by company.
- **Phase 3: Company H1B Sponsorship Databases**
  - Sub-task 3.1: Search for existing databases that track company H1B sponsorship.
  - Sub-task 3.2: Investigate APIs or data access for these databases.
- **Phase 4: Technical & Legal**
  - Sub-task 4.1: Research best practices for building job aggregation platforms.
  - Sub-task 4.2: Investigate web scraping legality and best practices.
  - Sub-task 4.3: Analyze successful H1B job platforms.
  - Sub-task 4.4: Research legal and compliance issues with using government and job board data.

## Key Questions
1. What are the most reliable and comprehensive data sources for H1B-sponsored jobs?
2. What are the costs and access methods (API, download, etc.) for each data source?
3. What are the legal and compliance requirements for using this data?
4. What is the recommended data architecture for an H1B job platform?

## Resource Strategy
- Primary data sources: Web search for APIs, government websites (USCIS, DOL), and existing H1B data providers.
- Search strategies: Use keywords like "H1B job API", "USCIS H1B employer data", "LCA data download", "company H1B sponsorship database", "job board API H1B".

## Verification Plan
- Source requirements: Prioritize official government sources, established data providers, and direct information from job boards.
- Cross-validation: Compare information from different sources to assess accuracy and completeness.

## Expected Deliverables
- A markdown file `docs/H1B_Data_Source_Research.md` containing a comprehensive list of data sources with analysis of access, quality, cost, and feasibility.
- A markdown file `docs/H1B_Platform_Recommendations.md` with recommendations for data architecture and a summary of legal/compliance considerations.

## Workflow Selection
- Primary focus: Search
- Justification: The task is primarily about discovering and gathering information from various online sources. The verification will be integrated into the search process by prioritizing authoritative sources.
